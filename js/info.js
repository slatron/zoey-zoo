      fun_fact: `Asia, India and Russia can weigh in at over 300 pounds and measure over 12 feet in length, they start off really tiny and completely helpless.
      About three and a half months after mating with a male tiger, the female tiger gives birth to her litter of cubs. She will usually choose a spot that's secluded and covered to have her babies. Typically, the birth of a litter of cubs takes about an hour, with cubs being born every 15 to 20 minutes. Cubs weigh approximately two pounds when they are born, and are blind and utterly dependent on their mother for food and protection.
After the tiger cubs are born, the mother tiger will eat the umbilical cord, placenta and embryonic sac. She cleans each cub by licking it with her rough tongue. The cubs then search for a teat in order to nurse, which is no easy feat since they can't see! This can take up to four hours, and because the mother tiger does not assist her cubs in locating a teat, sometimes cubs starve to death. In captivity, tiger keepers often lead the cub to a teat so it can begin nursing`,

      fun_fact: `


Baby elephants stay very close to their mothers for the first couple of months. The calves drink their mother's milk for about two years, sometimes longer. They drink up to 3 gallons of milk a day! At about four months old, they also begin eating some plants, like adult elephants, but they continue to need as much milk from their mother. They keep drinking milk for up to ten years!

At first, baby elephants don't really know what to do with their trunks. They swing them to and fro and sometimes even step on them. They will suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its thumb.

By about 6 to 8 months, calves begin learning to use their trunks to eat and drink. By they time they are a year old, they can control their trunks pretty well and, like adult elephants, use their trunks for grasping, eating, drinking, bathing.

Female elephants stay with the herd for life, while males leave to begin a solitary life at about 12 to 14 years of age.
