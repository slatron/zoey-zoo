`Mating occurs throughout the year,
but the height of mating season for the Grevy's zebra lasts from August through October,
    with the female giving birth during Africaâ€™s rainy season. Once mated,
     there is a gestation period of 12 to 13 months, and then the female gives birth to one newborn,
      or foal. Zebras are born with their stripes, which appear brown and white at birth.
       A foal is well developed at birth and weighs an average of 70 pounds`,
